# n8n-nodes-cloudflare-r2 Development Scratchpad

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive n8n community node for Cloudflare R2 object storage, following the successful pattern established by the n8n-nodes-cloudflare-d1 project.

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Created directory structure
- [ ] package.json configuration
- [ ] TypeScript configuration  
- [ ] Gulpfile for build process

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] CloudflareR2Api credentials
- [ ] R2 types and interfaces
- [ ] R2 utility functions
- [ ] Main CloudflareR2 node implementation

### Phase 3: Features & Polish
- [ ] SVG icon
- [ ] Documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, DEPLOYMENT)
- [ ] Testing and validation
- [ ] Git repository initialization

## Technical Decisions

### Node Structure (Based on D1 Analysis)
Following the resource-based operation structure from D1 node:
- **Objects**: Upload, Download, Delete, Get Info, List, Copy
- **Buckets**: Create, List, Delete, Get Info, Update Settings  
- **Advanced**: Multipart uploads, temporary credentials, CORS management
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk uploads/downloads/deletes

### API Integration Strategy
Using Cloudflare REST API endpoints from the comprehensive API reference:
- Base URL: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4`
- Authentication: API Token with R2 permissions
- Account ID required for all operations

### Key API Endpoints to Implement
**Bucket Operations:**
- GET/POST `/accounts/{account_id}/r2/buckets` - List/Create buckets
- GET/DELETE `/accounts/{account_id}/r2/buckets/{bucket_name}` - Get/Delete bucket

**Object Operations (via S3-Compatible API):**
- PUT/GET/DELETE objects using S3-compatible endpoints
- Multipart upload support
- Batch operations (up to 1000 objects)

### AI Agent Compatibility
- `usableAsTool: true` property
- Detailed, AI-friendly descriptions for all operations
- Clear parameter documentation with examples

## Development Notes

### From D1 Node Analysis
- Uses TypeScript with proper n8n workflow interfaces
- Resource-based operation structure works well
- Comprehensive error handling with continueOnFail support
- Utils class for common operations
- Types file for proper TypeScript definitions
- Version 2 node structure with subtitle parameter display

### R2-Specific Considerations
- Binary data handling for file uploads/downloads
- Support for various content types and metadata
- Multipart upload for large files
- Temporary credentials for secure access
- CORS policy management
- Object lifecycle management

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Created directory structure
- [x] package.json configuration
- [x] TypeScript configuration  
- [x] Gulpfile for build process

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ✅ (In Progress)
- [x] CloudflareR2Api credentials
- [x] R2 types and interfaces
- [x] R2 utility functions
- [x] Main CloudflareR2 node implementation (needs TypeScript fixes)

### Phase 3: Features & Polish ✅
- [x] SVG icon
- [x] Documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, DEPLOYMENT, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] Testing and validation (TypeScript build issues)
- [ ] Git repository initialization

## Current Issues

### TypeScript Build Errors
The main node implementation has context issues where `this` is not correctly bound to IExecuteFunctions. 
The private methods need to be refactored as standalone functions that accept executeFunctions as a parameter.

Key areas needing fixes:
1. Method calls in execute() function - need to pass executeFunctions context
2. Private methods need to be converted to standalone functions
3. All `this.getNodeParameter()` calls need to be `executeFunctions.getNodeParameter()`
4. All utility function calls need proper executeFunctions context

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Complete the TypeScript refactoring to fix build errors
2. Test basic functionality with a simple operation (e.g., list buckets)
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add more comprehensive testing
5. Initialize git repository and commit working version

## API Reference Notes
From Cloudflare API docs - comprehensive endpoint coverage available:
- Full CRUD operations on buckets and objects
- Advanced features like CORS, lifecycle, event notifications
- Temporary access credentials for security
- Super Slurper for data migration
- Metrics and monitoring capabilities
