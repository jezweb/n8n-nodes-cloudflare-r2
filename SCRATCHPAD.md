# n8n-nodes-cloudflare-r2 Development Scratchpad

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive n8n community node for Cloudflare R2 object storage, following the successful pattern established by the n8n-nodes-cloudflare-d1 project.

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Created directory structure
- [ ] package.json configuration
- [ ] TypeScript configuration  
- [ ] Gulpfile for build process

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] CloudflareR2Api credentials
- [ ] R2 types and interfaces
- [ ] R2 utility functions
- [ ] Main CloudflareR2 node implementation

### Phase 3: Features & Polish
- [ ] SVG icon
- [ ] Documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, DEPLOYMENT)
- [ ] Testing and validation
- [ ] Git repository initialization

## Technical Decisions

### Node Structure (Based on D1 Analysis)
Following the resource-based operation structure from D1 node:
- **Objects**: Upload, Download, Delete, Get Info, List, Copy
- **Buckets**: Create, List, Delete, Get Info, Update Settings  
- **Advanced**: Multipart uploads, temporary credentials, CORS management
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk uploads/downloads/deletes

### API Integration Strategy
Using Cloudflare REST API endpoints from the comprehensive API reference:
- Base URL: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4`
- Authentication: API Token with R2 permissions
- Account ID required for all operations

### Key API Endpoints to Implement
**Bucket Operations:**
- GET/POST `/accounts/{account_id}/r2/buckets` - List/Create buckets
- GET/DELETE `/accounts/{account_id}/r2/buckets/{bucket_name}` - Get/Delete bucket

**Object Operations (via S3-Compatible API):**
- PUT/GET/DELETE objects using S3-compatible endpoints
- Multipart upload support
- Batch operations (up to 1000 objects)

### AI Agent Compatibility
- `usableAsTool: true` property
- Detailed, AI-friendly descriptions for all operations
- Clear parameter documentation with examples

## Development Notes

### From D1 Node Analysis
- Uses TypeScript with proper n8n workflow interfaces
- Resource-based operation structure works well
- Comprehensive error handling with continueOnFail support
- Utils class for common operations
- Types file for proper TypeScript definitions
- Version 2 node structure with subtitle parameter display

### R2-Specific Considerations
- Binary data handling for file uploads/downloads
- Support for various content types and metadata
- Multipart upload for large files
- Temporary credentials for secure access
- CORS policy management
- Object lifecycle management

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Created directory structure
- [x] package.json configuration
- [x] TypeScript configuration  
- [x] Gulpfile for build process

### Phase 2: Core Implementation ✅ 
- [x] CloudflareR2Api credentials
- [x] R2 types and interfaces
- [x] R2 utility functions
- [x] Main CloudflareR2 node implementation (v0.1.1 - working)

### Phase 3: Features & Polish ✅
- [x] SVG icon
- [x] Documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, DEPLOYMENT, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- [x] Testing and validation 
- [x] Git repository initialization
- [x] Published to npm as @jezweb/n8n-nodes-cloudflare-r2-storage

### Phase 4: Feature Enhancements (In Progress)
- [ ] Base64 data support for direct uploads
- [ ] Improved webhook integration
- [ ] Enhanced AI agent compatibility

## Current Task: Add Base64 Data Support

### Motivation
Users currently need an intermediate Code node to convert base64 data to binary before uploading to R2. 
Adding native base64 support would eliminate this extra step, especially useful for:
- Webhook integrations with base64 file data
- Form submissions with file uploads
- API responses with base64-encoded images
- AI agents passing base64 data directly

### Implementation Plan
1. **Add Base64 Data Source Option** (lines 326-340)
   - Add "Base64 Data" option to dataSource dropdown
   - Value: `base64Data`
   - Description: "Upload from base64-encoded string"

2. **Add Base64 Input Fields** (after line 373)
   - `base64Content`: Text input for base64 string (supports expressions)
   - `base64FileName`: Optional filename for the uploaded file
   - `base64MimeType`: Optional MIME type (auto-detect if not provided)

3. **Update Upload Logic** (lines 771-795)
   - Handle base64 data conversion to Buffer
   - Support both raw base64 and data URLs (data:image/png;base64,...)
   - Auto-detect content type from data URL prefix
   - Clean base64 string (remove prefixes and whitespace)

4. **Version Update**
   - Bump to v0.2.0 (minor version for new feature)
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with feature description

### Testing Requirements
- Raw base64 strings
- Data URLs with MIME type prefix
- Large base64 files
- Invalid base64 strings (error handling)
- JSON path expressions ({{ $json.file.data }})
- Batch operations with multiple base64 files

## API Reference Notes
From Cloudflare API docs - comprehensive endpoint coverage available:
- Full CRUD operations on buckets and objects
- Advanced features like CORS, lifecycle, event notifications
- Temporary access credentials for security
- Super Slurper for data migration
- Metrics and monitoring capabilities
